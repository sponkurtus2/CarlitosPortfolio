                        Bustrack is a project that I co-founded with two
                        friends, where we envisioned and brought to life an
                        innovative transportation platform.
                        My primary role
                        involved leading the design, development, and
                        implementation of the web application.

                        <li>It enhances safety and communication within the transportation system. This includes the
                            implementation of unique QR codes for each user,
                            enabling more efficient and secure access
